# Google Knowledge Graph API APP
## Built by Krista Triviso

## Project Description

The following application was built for the sole purpose of meeting the requirements for a technical review.

## Developer Instructions

- Download Github repository ![Here](https://github.com/ktriviso/Google_Knowledge_Graph_App).
- run `npm i` from root
- In case of errors, `npm i` in client folder
- In root, npm start
- In client, npm start
- Open http://localhost:3000/

## User Instructions

- Search anything, press Enter
- Search will return your results or throw error to re-search

## Technical Requirements

- Build a search page where a user can type a search query and see results from the Google Knowledge Graph API. Use React (you can use create-react-app to setup) and Carbon Design system.
- This is not a timed test but it should take about a day or less.
- If you do not manage to finish all of the tasks or had to make trade-offs because of time, include a brief write-up of the decisions you had to make and how you would approach things differently given more time.
- Once you have the front-end ready, add a simple server that will be responsible for making API requests to the Google Knowledge Graph API instead of making the requests directly from the browser.
- Once you have the server up and running, add a caching mechanism so that when you search for the same thing twice, only the first request goes to the Google Knowledge Graph API and the second one onward will be returned by your server. (this could be a simple in-memory cache, eg. a dictionary)
- Submit your work in a private BitBucket repo â€“ share it with p8-ram.
